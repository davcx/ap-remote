Web based autopilot control using ESP32 and Seatalk1

Seatalk 1 is a 9bit protocol with 9th bit being set to indicate a command byte. Decoding is done using the ESPSoftwareSerial library.
INitialise the software port as 8 bit and Space parity. Test the parity bit before reading data if it is set then the byte
being read is a command bit.

ESP32 sketch on Arduino IDE. Reads and writes Seatalk1 to display data and send AP commannds to control X10 smart pilot.

Seatalk processing in Core 0 on ESP32.
